Change happens, but we don’t choose it. It comes from the world around us, which also influences the trajectory of our next change-seeking 

Chapter 12 & 13 capture thus fork-in-the-road, where the hierarchical structure of neural networks offers a compelling explanation of consequence vs cause, of determinism 

Epilepsy is a great candidate for neural network: first later is hypotheses of causes of epilepsy

But third later is excitation vs inhibitory issues
